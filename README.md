# ZephyrRTOS Workspace Application Template ::ZPP C++20 API

![alt text](doc/img_logo.png)

This repositories on the hardware independent zephyr rtos project, one of the popular topics of recent years. It is also a new proof that embedded systems can meet the needs of C++. My workspace uses ZephyrRTOS and ZPP C++20 API. It is where you can start from basic hardware and run advanced 3rd party applications.  

Must install the ZPP module under the zephyr folder before compiling.
